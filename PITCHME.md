### Main objectives

- Study if a machine _can itself_ learn and adapt a reactive strategy to control a dynamic system (an aircraft) |
  - following a well defined flight plan |
  - by observing a skilled operator |
  - (and then) without a priori knowledge |
  - in different operational conditions |

### Secondary objectives

- Help define what is a good operator |
- Automatically generate flight assessment report |
- Benchmark existing A/P with new learnt strategy |

### Data

 - Which data? |
    - Aircraft system data |
    - Operator inputs |
    - Environmental data (flight plan, weather, ...) |
 - Is there already some data available? (EV for example?, ...) |

### Simulations

Simulations can be used to spped-up the learning process through exploration

 - Constraints:
    - Be able to Log all required data (see previous slide) |
    - Be able to launch scenario easily |
    - Be able to launch zillions of simulations (possibly quicker than real time) |

### Questions

- Which is the data (variables) required for such a project |
- Which is the data already usable (if it exists)? |
- What will pilots accept to do (in the frame of such a research)? |
